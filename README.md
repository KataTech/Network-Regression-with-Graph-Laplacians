# Network-Regression-with-Graph-Laplacians

This repository contains the implementation for the paper ["Network Regression with Graph Laplacians"](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/22-0681/22-0681.pdf) in R.

## Summary of the paper

Network data are increasingly available in various research fields, motivating statistical analysis for populations of networks where a network as a whole is viewed as a data point. The study of how a network changes as a function of covariates is often of paramount interest. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of networks, basic statistical tools available for scalar and vector data are no longer applicable. This motivates to extend the notion of regression to the case of responses that are network data. Here we propose to adopt conditional Frechet means implemented with both global least squares regression and local weighted least squares smoothing, extending the Frechet regression concept to networks that are quantified by their graph Laplacians. The challenge is to characterize the space of graph Laplacians so as to justify the application of Frechet regression. This characterization then leads to asymptotic rates of convergence for the corresponding M-estimators by applying empirical process methods. We demonstrate the usefulness and good practical performance of the proposed framework with simulations and with network data arising from resting-state fMRI in neuroimaging, as well as New York taxi records.

The communities with no less than 10 ROIs are highlighted using colored polygons. These communities are found to be associated with diﬀerent anatomical regions of the brain.
